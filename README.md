## Description
This is a live blog site for tech issues for all who desire to participate on this site. Users can register an account with the application but is not necessary to view the blog feed. This application uses MySql for database functionality, Handlebars for HTML templating, Bcrypt for encryption of user data, and other dependencies include Dotenv, Sequelize, Express, and MySql2. 

---

## Installation
As this program uses Node.js, Dotenv, MySql, and Sequalize dependencies, you will want to open an integrated terminal in the project folder to make sure those are installed. When cloning the respository, the package.json should already list the dependencies needed. First, you'll need to make sure the dependancies are installed on your maching by typing "npm i" into the terminal. Then, install the node modules by typing "npm i" into the terminal. If those dependancies are not listed in the package.json file, you can add them by typing "npm i express", "npm i mysql2", "npm i sequelize", "npm i bcrypt", "npm i dotenv", "npm i dotenv", "npm i handlebars", "npm i express-handlebars", "npm i connect-session-sequelize", and "npm i express-session" into the integrated terminal.

## Usage
This is a simple community-focused weblog where people interested in technology can post and comment on any range of topics. To read the blog posts, a user does not need an account. However, if a user would like to create posts and / or comment on other posts, they will need to sign-up for an account (which can be done via the login modal accessed at the top right of the nav bar).

## Contributors

## Testing
Testing files are not provided but can be done when forking and cloning the repository to your computer.  

---

## Development
This blog application is far from complete. Any future development should at least incorporate delete and edit functionality to the posts and comments, creation of personalized profile pages, and the ability to search or sort through posts on a variety of logical criteria.
